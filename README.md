# 🎓 Student Dropout Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a student is at risk of dropping out based on academic performance, demographic details, and financial information using Machine Learning classification techniques.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a classification model that identifies students likely to drop out, enabling early intervention and academic support.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: UCI Student Dropout and Academic Success Dataset
- Total Records: 4,424
- Features include:
  - Academic performance (grades, evaluations, approvals)
  - Tuition fee status
  - Scholarship status
  - Debtor status
  - Parental education and occupation
  - Economic indicators (GDP, unemployment rate)
- Target Variable:
  - Dropout (1)
  - Not Dropout (0)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## 📈 Model Performance
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~86%
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~85%
- Decision Tree Accuracy: ~78%

## 🔎 Key Insights
- Academic performance and tuition status strongly influence dropout risk.
- Logistic Regression performed best in terms of generalization.
- The model successfully identified most dropout students.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🚀 Conclusion
The project demonstrates how classification models can be used to predict student dropout risk with strong accuracy, helping institutions take preventive action.
